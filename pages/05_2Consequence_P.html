                <p>From the documentary TV series, "Murder on the Internet (2017),"<a href="#section6" class="footnote footnote_figure">(Figure 24)</a> which shows the danger of finding love online,<a href="#section8" class="footnote"><sup>55</sup></a> I found that quantity of the online conversation doesn‚Äôt always guarantee the deeper and sincere connection. Most of the cases featured in this documentary reveal that victims developed trust with the perpetrator within just two weeks, solely through high-volume texting. </p>

        <section>
                <p>In one particular case, the victim and the perpetrator exchanged 2,600 messages over 13 days.<a href="#section8" class="footnote"><sup>56</sup></a> It seems to me that the power and speed of online communication facilitated the victim's trust and emotional attachment to the perpetrator. However, their relationship turned out to be insincere, resulting in the victim being raped and murdered.</p>

                <p>Another example of online love being used in romance scams is documented in Netflix's "The Tinder Swindler (2022)."<a href="#section7" class="footnote footnote_figure">(Figure 25)</a> The documentary recounts the story of Simon Hayt, also known as Shimon Leviev, who created a false digital persona posing as the son of an Israeli diamond mogul billionaire.<a href="#section8" class="footnote"><sup>57</sup></a> </p>

                <p>Despite Tinder's claims that new social connections or romantic relationships can be forged through simple texting and meetups within your local area in a short period of time, these documentaries shed light on the real dangers of dating someone you don't truly know. </p>
