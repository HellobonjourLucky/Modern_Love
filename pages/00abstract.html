                <p>Yet, various factors, including social networking services, behavioral addiction, algorithms, and online conversations without physical meetups, can influence our decisions and relationships. Therefore, to gain a deeper understanding of modern relationships, it is crucial to be more conscious about the journey of how we fall in love via a machine. </p>
