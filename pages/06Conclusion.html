                <p>It is undeniable that datafication and algorithms have reshaped individual lifestyles and redefined modern relationships, expanding their social circles. Particularly in the realm of romantic relationships, these mechanisms have ushered in a modern era of dating renaissance by recommending perfect matches based on individual preferences, current location, and past behavioral data.</p>

                <p>However, for a deeper understanding of modern relationships in the realm of online dating, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive analysis of these mechanisms‚Äô societal impacts, such as addiction issues and mental health concerns. Additionally, features like the proximity feature in dating applications and excessive online conversations can increase the potential for exposure to insecurity and crime.</p>

                <p>Despite the 2023 Tinder report revealing that many users have found serious or new relationships through the platform,  people often struggle to form deep and sincere connections due to the absence of an in-person 'getting-to-know' stage.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
                <p>This absence of face-to-face interaction means missing out on diverse experiences with different people. For example, in traditional social settings like schools, workplaces, sports clubs, or social events, we encounter a variety of individuals, including those with differing opinions or who are polar opposites. These interactions help us learn to accept and understand others‚Äô differences. However, if we only surround ourselves with like-minded individuals, we risk becoming narrow-minded and missing out on diversity.</p>

        <section>
                <p>The same applies to the online dating market: algorithms recommend people we are likely to like, but they may not introduce us to individuals who are significantly different from us. This can confine us to a certain pool and limit our exposure to diversity. Within this limited pool, I only communicate with the people I like, in my neighborhood. Even though this process may seem ideal and pragmatic, I believe it's important to immerse ourselves more into real-life social environments to genuinely get to know people's authentic selves and embrace their diversity.</p>

        <section>
                <p>Thus, I strongly believe that this physical adventure will help us regain autonomy to decide whom we meet and to define the nature of our relationships. Then, we have the power to redefine the modern dating renaissance ourselves.</p>
