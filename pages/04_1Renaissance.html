                <p>Online dating is now the most common way that people can make new connections since the pandemic. A recent survey reveals that not only are a majority of individuals under 30 using dating apps, but more than half (55%) have engaged in a serious relationship with someone they met on Tinder.<a href="#section9" class="footnote"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

                <p>Tinder, which is the world‚Äôs most popular app for meeting new people and available in 190 countries, published the Dating Report on 2023, "A Renaissance in Dating, Driven by Authenticity," which researched new dating trends influenced by the pandemic.<a href="#section9" class="footnote"><sup>41</sup></a> This report said that the development of dating application has changed the way we connect with potential partners regardless of location and time.</p>

        <section>
                <p>According to the survey, two-thirds (66%) of members believe that Tinder enables them to date individuals beyond their immediate social circles or connect with people they wouldn't have met in their daily lives.<a href="#section9" class="footnote"><sup>42</sup></a> Breaking people out of their immediate social bubbles has evolved into a more diverse dating landscape, encompassing racial, cultural, and geographical diversity.</p>

                <p>In addition to connect people from different parts of the world, the hidden algorithm of dating apps plays a crucial role in preventing time wastage. According to the Tinder report, "Due to the intermittent lockdowns over the past years, young daters are now more mindful of time. They are being pragmatic (89%) in their approach to dating, compensating for lost time." </p>

                <p>"A significant portion, 77% of Tinder members, respond to a crush within 30 minutes, with 40% responding within five minutes and over a third replying immediately. This time-conscious attitude is translating into faster transitions from online connections to offline meetups. (The Future of Dating, 2024)"<a href="#section9" class="footnote"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
        </section>
        <section>
                <p>Based on the report and statistics, I agree that Tinder which is representing online dating culture brings about a modern day of Renaissance in dating, in a sense that people can experience with new cultural movement which is making the transition in many areas, such as philosophy, art, politics, exploration, and humanity.</p>

        <section>
                <p>Similar to the historical Renaissance, which had a subsequent impact on how individuals viewed and understood the world,<a href="#section9" class="footnote"><sup>44</sup></a> the Tinder Renaissance has also changed how individuals perceive relationships with others and understand the world through the experience of a new dating culture.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
                <p>However, it seems to me that the online dating market is a double-edged sword by causing unexpected consequences, even though it facilitates increased offline meetups through its diverse dating landscape and online conversation.</p>
