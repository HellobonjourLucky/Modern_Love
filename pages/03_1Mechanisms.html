                <p>Most people think that the advent of smart devices cause many problems. But I believe the mechanisms embedded within social networking applications are primarily responsible for social problems, such as the obsession of digital self-presentation and many addictive problems. Particularly in Instagram, TikTok, or Tinder, these platforms offer highly satisfying personal experiences that entice users to spend extended periods of time using their services.</p>

                <p>To deliver this personalized experience, social networking platforms gather extensive data, and users often provide their personal data and preferences without much consideration. Then, algorithms process all user data to enhance the service and offer more personalized experiences to users. Consequently, algorithms have become powerful tools for driving automated decisions to provide highly satisfying personalized experiences, despite the simple definition of algorithms as a procedure for solving computational problems with mathematics.<a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

                <p>The original purpose of algorithms is essentially to mimic the decision-making mechanisms of the human brain.<a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>29</sup></a> At the basic level of process, Carolyne Lyden, an expert of digital marketing and a writer, said: "algorithms consist of a series of ‚Äòif-then statements‚Äô executed rapidly in a computer to generate an outcome: If action A is taken, then the result is B. Alternatively, if action C is chosen, then the result is D. <a href="#section4" class="footnote footnote_figure">(Figure 10)</a><a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>30</sup></a>  Depending on the response, specific options become the preferred choices. The concept is that each path leads in a certain direction, and the computer follows to the workflow for the next step.
