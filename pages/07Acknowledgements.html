                <p>I would like to thank my supervisor, <span class="acknowledgements_name">F√ºsun T√ºretken</span>, for her invaluable guidance and for broadening my perspective through practical suggestions and academic advice.</p>

                <p>I would also like to express my gratitude to <span class="acknowledgements_name">my family</span>, without whom none of this would have been possible. Their tremendous understanding and encouragement made it possible for me to complete this journey. They wholeheartedly supported my decisions and inspired me to become a better person. Therefore, I want to extend endless love and gratitude to them.</p>

                <p>I express my sincere gratitude to my Superman, <span class="acknowledgements_name">Antti Harju</span>, for sharing his academic knowledge and unparalleled support. Ever since he became my coding guru, his kindness, sweetness, and understanding have always made me feel safe and helped me when I strayed. Most importantl, I would like to thank him for making every moment delightful with simple things, like a "potato," and offering his shoulder to lean on.</p>

                <p>I would like to extend my sincere thanks to Captain <span class="acknowledgements_name">Lukas Dwan</span> for sharing his artistic insight and research every time I start a project. Not only does his academic support inspire me, but his adventurous spirit also amuses me greatly. Additionally, I‚Äôd like to thank him for being a true friend who doesn‚Äôt compete but only supports. However, I should admit that we only compete to see who is dumber, but he always wins (not joking).</p>

                <p>I‚Äôm deeply indebted to my best friends, including <span class="acknowledgements_name">Taotao, Merijn, and Jiye,</span> for their continuous help and support. Their kindness and presence make me feel safe, creative, and welcomed. Also, their diverse artistic talents and profound research thinking inspire me to break out of my comfort zone. Especially, without <span class="acknowledgements_name">Tao's</span> support, encouragement and practical help for four years, I wouldn‚Äôt have reached this point.</p>

                <p>I am extremely grateful to <span class="acknowledgements_name">Ingrid Grunwald</span> for always being there and wholeheartedly listening to us. Without her and our 'Wednesday tea parties,' I am certain I wouldn't have completed the courses so smoothly. Additionally, her visits to my internship place and academic support brought sunshine to my current/future journey. Therefore, I deeply appreciate her genuine kindness.</p>
