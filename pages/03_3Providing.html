                <p>In addition to facilitating personal experiences, algorithms have transformed social relationships in dating landscape, assuming the role of matchmakers. Because the chances of finding the ideal match through an algorithm surpasses that of a traditional matchmaker, as a dating algorithm has larger data pools. These data pools not only encompass a vast user pool but also effectively filter individual preferences, enabling the algorithm to identify the best match based on user preference data.</p>

                <p>More specifically, the matchmaking algorithm uses both of machine learning and datafication to make predictions about the potential best match. Woz U, one of the online technology training program organizations, posted: "The algorithm is responsible for matching users based on their preferences and behavior data. The preferences include factors like age, interests, location and education. The more data the algorithm has to work with, the better its predictions will be. This is why many dating apps encourage users to fill out their profiles as completely as possible. <a href="#section4" class="footnote footnote_figure">(Figure 12)</a><a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>34</sup></a> Even, some dating apps also take into account users‚Äô browsing history or sync their social media profile to propose the most relevant matches.(Woz U, 2023)"<a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

                <p>Furthermore, the algorithm considers user‚Äôs behavioral information along with their app activities, such as swiping, the number of matches, and the pattern of exchanged messages. For instance, if a user consistently swipe right on individuals with specific apperance or education criteria, the algorithm incorporates this data to propose similar matches in the future, taking users‚Äô past behaviors into account to predict what they will like next.</p>
