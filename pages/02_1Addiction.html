                <p>According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) issued by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) issued by the World Health Organization (WHO), addiction entails recurring symptoms resulting from the persistent use of a substance, such as alcohol, caffeine, or psychedelic substances, despite adverse effects.<a href="#section6" class="footnote"><sup>7</sup></a> However, I believe the field of addictions has experienced a notable transformation in recent times. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
                <p>Because, although significant efforts have been made to comprehend the neurobiological foundations of substance addiction, it seems less focus has been placed on examining the potentially 'addictive' qualities of repetitive behaviors. This prompts questions regarding whether such behaviors should be categorized as 'behavioral addictions.'</p>
        </section>
        <section>
                <p>Consequently, the latest revision of the DSM-5 and ICD-11 suggests that "Certain conditions, such as gambling disorder, compulsive buying, excessive pornography consumption, and problematic internet use, exhibit phenomenological and neurobiological similarities to substance use disorders."<a href="#section6" class="footnote"><sup>8</sup></a> </p>

                <p>One of the most prevalent behavioral addictions in contemporary society is the excessive usage of online social networking, primarily driven by the advent of the Internet and smart devices.<a href="#section6" class="footnote"><sup>9</sup></a> In contrast of earlier communication technologies like the telegraph, telephone and radio, the massive expansion of networks facilitated by the Internet and smart devices is unparalleled.<a href="#section6" class="footnote"><sup>10</sup></a> </p>

        <section>
                <p>The growth of digital communication has led to faster, more efficient, and more accessible connections, regardless geographical distances. However, I think the societal implications of this digital communication are still under debate, encompassing both the strengthening of personal relationships and the risks of addiction.</p>
