            <p>The most well-known and prevalent addictions included substance-related disorders such as alcohol, caffeine, psychedelic substances, and tobacco. However, contemporary society witnesses a shift towards behavioral addictions induced by the Internet and smart devices, encompassing activities like gaming, pornography consumption, shopping, and social media engagement.  These behavioral addictions, once viewed as individual problems, now demand consideration as overarching societal issues, impacting diverse facets of society, including physical and mental health, relationships, careers, and communities.</p>

            <p>One of the most common behavioral addictions is overuse of online social networking.  And I think, compared to substance addiction, this behavioral addiction is considered as a mild and easy-to-fix problem. Yet, a nuanced understanding of technological mechanisms reveals the unconscious manipulation and the gravity of this problem.  Especially, on dating market, algorithm controls the individuals displayed in the swipe list, relinquishing control over who they encounter in real-life interactions. And it seems obvious to me that this algorithmic process tailors personalized experiences, encouraging prolonged user engagement.</p>

            <p>But it is true that Tinder, which represents the online dating markets, opens a new chapter of dating industry with the algorithmic datafication and it has a huge impact on users’ relationship. Such as, distance and location play an important role in this dating application, as the application prioritizes matches based on proximity, increasing chances in-person meetings based on users’ location data.  But we easily forget the ramifications. For example, the cyber space allows simultaneous conversations with multiple people at the same time, challenging commitment in one conversation or a deeper relationship.  As a result, these interactions often have restrictions and can even pose risks. Because these easy interactions may transform romantic relationships into a seemingly mindless activity.</p>

            <p>Therefore, this thesis explores the detailed understanding of behavioral addiction and conducts a comprehensive analysis of how the application’s algorithm impacts our online relationships. Ultimately, it seeks an enhanced understanding of modern relationships in the realm of cyber dating space.</p>
