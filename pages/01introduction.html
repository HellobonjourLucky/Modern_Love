                <p>The most well-known and prevalent addictions included substance-related disorders such as alcohol, caffeine, psychedelic substances, and tobacco. However, contemporary society witnesses a shift towards behavioral addictions induced by the Internet and smart devices, encompassing activities like gaming, pornography consumption, shopping, and social media engagement.<a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>2</sup></a> These behavioral addictions, once viewed as individual problems, now demand consideration as overarching societal issues, impacting diverse facets of society, including physical and mental health, relationships, careers, and communities.</p>

                <p>One of the most common behavioral addictions is overuse of online social networking.<a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>3</sup></a> And I think, compared to substance addiction, this behavioral addiction is considered as a mild and easy-to-fix problem. Yet, a nuanced understanding of technological mechanisms reveals the unconscious manipulation and the gravity of this problem.<a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>4</sup></a>  Especially, on dating market, algorithm controls the individuals displayed in the swipe list, relinquishing control over who they encounter in real-life interactions. And it seems obvious to me that this algorithmic process tailors personalized experiences, encouraging prolonged user engagement.</p>

                <p>But it is true that Tinder, which represents the online dating markets, opens a new chapter of dating industry with the algorithmic datafication and it has a huge impact on users‚Äô relationship. Such as, distance and location play an important role in this dating application, as the application prioritizes matches based on proximity, increasing chances in-person meetings based on users‚Äô location data.<a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>5</sup></a>  But we easily forget the ramifications. For example, the cyber space allows simultaneous conversations with multiple people at the same time, challenging commitment in one conversation or a deeper relationship.<a href="#section5" class="footnote"><sup>6</sup></a>  As a result, these interactions often have restrictions and can even pose risks. Because these easy interactions may transform romantic relationships into a seemingly mindless activity.

                <p>Therefore, this thesis explores the detailed understanding of behavioral addiction and conducts a comprehensive analysis of how the application‚Äôs algorithm impacts our online relationships. Ultimately, it seeks an enhanced understanding of modern relationships in the realm of cyber dating space.</p>
